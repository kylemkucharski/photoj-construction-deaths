    <h1>Construction-Related Deaths in New York City</h1>  <!-->
    <h2>By Madeleine Crenshaw, Graison Dangor, Kyle Kucharski, Sarah Matusek and Anya Van Wagtendonk</h2>
    <p>Orange netting. Hunter green fences. In every borough and nearly every neighborhood of New York City, construction scaffolding is a familiar sight. Here, buildings are always in bloom. And as zoning laws change and development expands, gleaming new
      edifices seem to pop up overnight.</p>

    <p>But Gotham doesn’t grow itself. Construction workers — carpenters, electricians, roofers, pipefitters, equipment operators, ironworkers — build the city upward. After their work ends and the scaffolds collapse, our streets and skylines are altered.
      We live, work and play within these creations.</p>

    <p>This work is dangerous. According to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/survey/construction-fatalities.pdf">construction workers comprise</a> only 5 percent of our city’s workforce, yet 27
      percent of work-related fatalities. Although deaths have decreased in recent years, five construction workers died in the first three months of 2018.</p>

    <p>These on-the-job deaths result in violations issued by the Department of Buildings and the Environmental Control Board, fines that are easily paid off to resume construction. As a result, any New Yorker can walk past a house, an apartment building,
      a shuttered construction site, and never know that a person died at that spot while on the job. Thanks to monthly <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/cons_accident_monthly_0318.pdf">DOB reports</a>, these grim statistics are public
      if you know where to look.</p>

    <p>As photographers, we tracked down these death sites to explore what it means to live in a city built through sacrifice. We visited every building where a construction worker perished between January 2017 and March 2018, photographing each unintended
      memorial.
    </p>

    <p>The following images aren’t extraordinary, but that’s the point. Their repetitive ordinariness reminds us that our built environment carries a legacy, left behind by working New Yorkers.</p>
